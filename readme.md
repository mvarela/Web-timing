# Web Timing Measurement

These tools and data were developed (and collected) back in 2012 for the 
instrumentation of a Web QoE subjective campaign. The idea was to develop 
realistic latency models for different types of web sites, and different types of 
content (HTML, images, javascript, CSS).

Due to the lack of headless tools, it used some specific MacOS tool for
simulating clicks and driving the Safari UI. If this were to be redone now, it 
would make sense to use headless Chrome, or similar.

The code is provided as-is, and so is the data (which is likely quite obsolete by now)
